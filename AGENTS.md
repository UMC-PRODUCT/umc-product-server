## OVERVIEW

UMC PRODUCT Backend is a Java 21 / Spring Boot 3.5 API server built with strict Hexagonal Architecture,
DDD-style domain rules, JPA, QueryDSL, Flyway, JWT/SSO, REST/GraphQL APIs, OpenAPI,
Prometheus, and OpenTelemetry.

All agent responses, generated reviews, and documentation comments must be in Korean unless identifiers or standard technical terms require English.

## STRUCTURE

Gradle multi-module. `:monolith` holds everything not yet extracted, `:blog` is the first extracted
domain, and `:app` packages the boot jar and verifies what actually got assembled. See `docs/adr/030-blog-gradle-module-extraction.md`.

```

Boot entry and `src/main/resources` stay in `:monolith` so `@SpringBootTest` can find the
configuration class.

Adding a module means four edits. Registering it in `settings.gradle.kts` alone is not enough,
and each omission below fails silently rather than breaking the build.

1. `settings.gradle.kts` - `include(":name")`
2. `app/build.gradle.kts` - add the dependency, otherwise it never reaches the boot jar
3. `gradle/documentation-catalog.gradle.kts` - add the source root, otherwise its error codes
   drop out of the catalog
4. `app/src/test/.../ApplicationAssemblyTest` - add a representative bean, so a missing step 2
   fails the build instead of shipping a jar without the module

Step 4 is what catches the others. Per-module tests only see their own module: `:blog:test` passes
even when `:blog` is absent from the boot jar.

## ARCHITECTURE RULES

- Layers are `domain`, `application`, and `adapter`; dependency direction must point inward.
- Allowed: `adapter/in -> application/port/in`, `application/service -> domain`, `adapter/out -> application/port/out`.
- Forbidden: `domain -> application/adapter`, `application/port -> application/service`, `adapter/in -> adapter/out`.
- Cross-domain references must use IDs, not another domain aggregate object.
- When Domain A needs Domain B data, inject Domain B's public Query UseCase. Never access Domain B's entities or repositories directly.
- Within the same aggregate, `@ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)` is allowed for parent/root references.
- `@OneToMany` collections are forbidden, even inside the same domain.
- State changes belong in explicit domain methods. Avoid anemic entities.

## CONVENTIONS

- Command UseCases and Query UseCases stay separate. Command services use `@Transactional`; Query services use `@Transactional(readOnly = true)`.
- Controllers return adapter `Response` records or application `Info` values. They do not return entities and do not wrap success responses in `ApiResponse`.
- REST controllers live under `adapter/in/web`; GraphQL controllers live under `adapter/in/graphql`.
- REST API URIs must be resource-first: start with `/api/v{version}/{domain}` and use stable, kebab-case resource nouns after the domain segment.
- Admin REST APIs must use `/api/v{version}/{domain}/admin/...`; do not create new admin APIs under `/api/v{version}/admin/{domain}/...`.
- Treat `admin` as an access/control surface inside the owning domain, not as a top-level domain. When changing controller paths, update controller tests, security/maintenance allow paths, and onboarding/API guide documents together.
- GraphQL schema files in `monolith/src/main/resources/graphql` are API contracts and must stay aligned with GraphQL DTOs.
- SSO/PKCE flows must not log authorization codes, login tokens, refresh tokens, or client secrets.
- Request records live under `adapter/in/web/dto/request` and convert to command/query objects near the adapter boundary.
- Response records live under `adapter/in/web/dto/response` and usually expose `from(Info)`.
- Query DTOs in `application/port/in/query/dto` end with `Info`; command DTOs end with `Command`.
- JPA repositories follow Spring Data names (`findById`, `findAllBy...`, `existsBy...`). Custom Ports/UseCases use semantic names.
- `get[By]` returns `T` and throws if missing; `find[By]` returns `Optional<T>` and never throws not-found; `list[By]` returns a non-null list.
- `batchGet[By]` requires all inputs to exist; `search[By]` is for dynamic/complex filters.
- Static factories: `of` for multiple params, `from` for one source, `create`/`newInstance` for guaranteed new instances.
- QueryDSL code belongs in `*QueryRepository`; avoid N+1 by fetch joins, split queries, or IN/batch maps.
- Flyway files use `VYYYY.MM.DD.HH.MM__snake_case.sql`; duplicate versions are checked by Gradle.

## AUTHORIZATION

- ChallengerRole-backed staff authority is scoped to a gisu. New resource permission checks that have a resource gisu must use `...InGisu(...)` predicates with the resource's gisu.
- `...InGisu(...)` scopes ChallengerRole evaluation only. Member-wide system roles such as `SUPER_ADMIN` remain global overrides and may short-circuit a gisu-scoped policy.
- `...InAnyGisu(...)` predicates are allowed for intentionally global or gisu-agnostic surfaces. Existing cross-gisu behavior covered by compatibility tests must not be tightened inside a refactor; move it to `...InGisu(...)` only through an explicitly approved policy change.
- Use `ListChallengerRoleUseCase` for role read models and `CheckChallengerAuthorityUseCase` for boolean authority decisions. `GetChallengerRoleUseCase` exists as a compatibility facade; do not introduce it in new code unless an existing constructor/API boundary requires it.
- Boolean authority checks must fail closed for nonexistent members through the member domain's dedicated existence Query UseCase before consulting legacy role data.
- `ResourcePermissionEvaluator` implementations should evaluate `SubjectAttributes.toAuthoritySnapshot()` instead of re-querying ChallengerRole data or manually streaming raw role lists.
- When ChallengerRole data or member system role data changes, evict the `AUTHORITY_SNAPSHOT` cache through the authorization cache usecase. Cache serialized DTOs, not domain entities. The current Caffeine adapter is instance-local, so do not claim cross-instance immediate revocation without distributed invalidation or authority version checks.
- `SUPER_ADMIN` is a member-bound global system role stored only by the member domain (`member_system_role`). It must not be added to `ChallengerRoleType`, persisted in `challenger_role`, or exposed through ChallengerRole command/query APIs.
- Authorization refactors must preserve client-visible API paths, request/response shapes, and status semantics unless the issue explicitly includes a client contract change. Add tests that lock existing behavior before replacing predicates.

## ANTI-PATTERNS

- No `@Setter` on entities.
- No `@OneToMany` entity collections.
- No business logic in controllers.
- No controller-to-repository or controller-to-adapter/out dependency.
- No entity exposure from controllers.
- No missing `@Valid` on request bodies.
- No missing transaction boundary on command services.
- No `new` for command/domain entity creation outside adapter/test boundaries; use factories or builders.
- No direct cross-domain repository/model access.
- No hidden N+1 query path.
- No AI authorship trailers or AI committer/author metadata.

## TESTING

- Unit tests prefer JUnit 5 + Mockito with `@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)`.
- Integration tests reuse `IntegrationTestSupport`; persistence slices reuse `PersistenceAdapterTest`; web slices reuse `ControllerTestSupport`.
- Test names and `@DisplayName` values should be Korean and behavior-focused.
- Given/When/Then structure is expected.
- Fixture code lives in `monolith/src/testFixtures/java/com/umc/product/support/fixture` and should persist through SavePorts where possible.

## REVIEW AND GIT

- Review priorities: P1 security/data loss/severe bugs; P2 architecture/performance/scalability; P3 code quality/conventions; P4 alternatives; P5 typos/questions.
- Commit format is `<type>: <subject>` with `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, or `chore`.
- PR titles use `[Feat]`, `[Fix]`, `[HotFix]`, `[Refactor]`, `[Chore]`, `[Docs]`, or `[Release]`; development PRs target `develop`.
- Never set AI authorship, AI committer metadata, or `Co-authored-by` trailers for AI tools.

## COMMANDS

```bash
./gradlew :app:bootRun
./gradlew check                      # CI and completion criteria use this single entry point
./gradlew :monolith:test :blog:test
./gradlew :app:bootJar               # app/build/libs/app.jar
./gradlew checkstyleMain -PlintAll   # full scan instead of changed files only
```

`check` covers spotless, checkstyle for every source set, tests, the Flyway duplicate-version task,
and the documentation catalog. Listing tasks by hand silently drops newly added checks.

## NOTES

- Default profile is `local`; app port is `8080`; management/Prometheus port is `9090`.
- `bootJar`는 배포용 JAR을 생성한다. Checkstyle 작업은 변경 파일을 기준으로 실행한다.
- `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` are pointers to this canonical file.
