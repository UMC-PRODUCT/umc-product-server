## OVERVIEW

UMC Product Backend is a Java 21 / Spring Boot 3.5 API server built with strict Hexagonal Architecture,
DDD-style domain rules, JPA, QueryDSL, Flyway, JWT/SSO, REST/GraphQL APIs, OpenAPI, REST Docs,
Prometheus, and OpenTelemetry.

All agent responses, generated reviews, and documentation comments must be in Korean unless identifiers or standard technical terms require English.

## CODE MAP

Java LSP (`jdtls`) and `codegraph_*` tools were not available in this session, so reference counts are unmeasured.

## ARCHITECTURE RULES

- Layers are `domain`, `application`, and `adapter`; dependency direction must point inward.
- Allowed: `adapter/in -> application/port/in`, `application/service -> domain`, `adapter/out -> application/port/out`.
- Forbidden: `domain -> application/adapter`, `application/port -> application/service`, `adapter/in -> adapter/out`.
- Cross-domain references must use IDs, not another domain aggregate object.
- When Domain A needs Domain B data, inject Domain B's public Query UseCase. Never access Domain B's entities or repositories directly.
- Within the same aggregate, `@ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)` is allowed for parent/root references.
- `@OneToMany` collections are forbidden, even inside the same domain.
- State changes belong in explicit domain methods. Avoid anemic entities.

## CONVENTIONS

- Command UseCases and Query UseCases stay separate. Command services use `@Transactional`; Query services use `@Transactional(readOnly = true)`.
- Controllers return adapter `Response` records or application `Info` values. They do not return entities and do not wrap success responses in `ApiResponse`.
- REST controllers live under `adapter/in/web`; GraphQL controllers live under `adapter/in/graphql`.
- GraphQL schema files in `src/main/resources/graphql` are API contracts and must stay aligned with GraphQL DTOs.
- SSO/PKCE flows must not log authorization codes, login tokens, refresh tokens, or client secrets.
- Request records live under `adapter/in/web/dto/request` and convert to command/query objects near the adapter boundary.
- Response records live under `adapter/in/web/dto/response` and usually expose `from(Info)`.
- Query DTOs in `application/port/in/query/dto` end with `Info`; command DTOs end with `Command`.
- JPA repositories follow Spring Data names (`findById`, `findAllBy...`, `existsBy...`). Custom Ports/UseCases use semantic names.
- `get[By]` returns `T` and throws if missing; `find[By]` returns `Optional<T>` and never throws not-found; `list[By]` returns a non-null list.
- `batchGet[By]` requires all inputs to exist; `search[By]` is for dynamic/complex filters.
- Static factories: `of` for multiple params, `from` for one source, `create`/`newInstance` for guaranteed new instances.
- QueryDSL code belongs in `*QueryRepository`; avoid N+1 by fetch joins, split queries, or IN/batch maps.
- Flyway files use `VYYYY.MM.DD.HH.MM__snake_case.sql`; duplicate versions are checked by Gradle.
- REST Docs snippets use `{class-name}/{method-name}` and are assembled into `docs/static`.

## ANTI-PATTERNS

- No `@Setter` on entities.
- No `@OneToMany` entity collections.
- No business logic in controllers.
- No controller-to-repository or controller-to-adapter/out dependency.
- No entity exposure from controllers.
- No missing `@Valid` on request bodies.
- No missing transaction boundary on command services.
- No `new` for command/domain entity creation outside adapter/test boundaries; use factories or builders.
- No direct cross-domain repository/model access.
- No hidden N+1 query path.
- No AI authorship trailers or AI committer/author metadata.

## TESTING

- Unit tests prefer JUnit 5 + Mockito with `@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)`.
- Integration tests reuse `IntegrationTestSupport`; persistence slices reuse `PersistenceAdapterTest`; REST Docs/web slices reuse `DocumentationTest`.
- Test names and `@DisplayName` values should be Korean and behavior-focused.
- Given/When/Then structure is expected.
- Fixture code lives in `src/test/java/com/umc/product/support/fixture` and should persist through SavePorts where possible.

## COMMANDS

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
./gradlew spotlessCheck checkstyleMain checkstyleTest
./gradlew compileJava compileTestJava
./gradlew test
./gradlew asciidoctor
./gradlew build
```

## NOTES

- Default profile is `local`; app port is `8080`; management/Prometheus port is `9090`.
- `build` depends on clean/docs copy behavior; `bootJar` is more deployment-focused.
- `checkstyleMain` and `checkstyleTest` are diff-oriented in this project.
- Existing `CLAUDE.md` is a legacy mirror of the previous root rules; keep behavior aligned with this `AGENTS.md`.
